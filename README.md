Mini Assignment #8

My twine story "The Life of Henry VI" is a detailed chose your own narrative detailing the life of Henry VI from his coronation as the King of England in 1432 to the start of the War of Roses in 1455. This narrative is a complex role player narrative that uses the Twine application to the fullest. Twine features that I have included in this narrative are multimedia using memes I created from IMGFlip that provide a illustrative and comedic context to my narrative as well as timing conditionals. This Twine narrative I created is meant to be an educating and informative experience that can provide insight into this aspect of Tudor history.
